This code is a fork of matteobrusa / Password-protection-for-static-pages.
The PIN I've used in this instance is 595826.
You can change it by creating a folder titled with the base-16 string (e.g. 9843563de49854e43424ec5a695f7d150f361521), and create an index.html that hides your code. 
For security reasons, you'll have to use this on a webpage other than Github, because it shows branching.
Thanks!
